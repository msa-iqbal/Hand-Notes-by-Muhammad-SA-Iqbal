# Explain of Algorithm
Product list:
                       
		        Name     -      Quantity          -      Net Price       -    Sell Price
                       iPhone   -         1              -        20,500        -       24,999
                       iPhone   -         2              -        20,500x2      -       24,999x2 
Billing:
                  
		  Product Name         –       Product Quantity      –     Total Amount
                    iPhone             -             2               -          49,998

Profit:   
                   
		   Profit (Sell Price – Net Price) = (49,998 – 41,000) = 8,998 tk.
                                      Thus, Profit = 8,998 tk

     Here, 
                Product Name: iPhone
                Product Net Price: 20,500 tk.
                Product Sell Price: 24,999 tk.
                Product Quantity: 2 pics
                Total Amount (Sell): 49,998 tk.
                Profit: 8,998 tk.
